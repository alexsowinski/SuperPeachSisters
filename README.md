# SuperPeachSisters
## Introduction
Super Peach Sisters is set in the Mushroom Queendom, fictional land of crazy creatures
like fire-breathing piranhas, koopas and goombas. Unfortunately, last week Mario was
taken hostage by the evil greenhouse gas producer named Yerac Grebnehcan (who is well
known for producing huge amounts of methane), and Peach must face a number of
increasingly difficult levels to rescue him.

Each level contains a number of challenges, which include dangerous koopas, goombas,
and fire-breathing Piranhas that grow from pipes. Peach must avoid or destroy these
creatures to reach the flag on each level, which takes her to the next level. Once Peach
reaches the final level, she must then get to Mario to save him and win the game. Each
level contains a number of goodies that Peach can reveal by bonking her head against
blocks. These goodies include Stars (which grant invincibility to Peach), Mushrooms
(which enable Peach to double her jumping height), and Flowers which enables Peach to
shoot fireballs at her opponents.

You, the player, will play the role of Peach and use the following keystrokes to control
her Peach:

● Left arrow key or the ‘a’ key: Moves Peach toward the left

● Right arrow key or the ‘d’ key: Moves Peach toward the right

● Up arrow key or the ‘w’ key: Causes peach to jump up

● Space bar: Fires a fireball, if Peach has any

● The ‘q’ key: Quits the game

● The ‘f’ and 'r' keys: Freeze and resume the game to aid with debugging

## Implementation Details
The logic of this interactive game is constructed utilizing objected-oriented design,
polymorhpism and inheritence. The primary data structure utilized is the vector from
the C++ Standard Template Library with dynamic allocation utilized in the game
initialization and cleanup steps.

## Usage
The executable with the accompanying assets are located in the "Executable" directory,
fascilitating gameplay without the need for complication. Otherwise, if compilation
is desired, the source files are located in the "SuperPeachSisters" directory.
